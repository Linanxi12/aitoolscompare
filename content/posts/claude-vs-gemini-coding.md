faq:
  - question: "Is Claude or Gemini better for coding?"
    answer: "Claude Opus 4 is significantly better for coding: 9.2 vs 8.2 overall. Claude produces more idiomatic, better-typed, more maintainable code, has a 200K context window (vs 1M for Gemini), and superior debugging instincts — surgical fixes over architectural overhauls. Gemini wins on speed (289 tok/s vs ~70 tok/s), free tier availability, and native multimodal understanding (video, charts). For production coding: Claude. For fast prototyping with visual data: Gemini."
  - question: "Is Gemini good enough for professional coding?"
    answer: "Gemini 2.5 Flash (8.2/10) is good enough for most professional coding — it's a capable AI coding assistant that produces correct, working code. But it trails Claude Opus 4 (9.2) on the details that separate working code from production code: idiomatic patterns, strict typing, edge-case handling, and maintainable architecture. For senior developers shipping production systems: Claude is worth the extra cost. For rapid prototyping and iteration: Gemini's speed (4× faster) is a genuine advantage."

## TL;DR: Quick Verdict ⚡

<div class="verdict-box">
  <div class="verdict-label">⚡ Bottom Line</div>
  <p class="verdict-text">
    <strong>Claude Opus 4 wins on code quality — decisively.</strong> Better code (9.2 vs 8.2), sharper debugging, more idiomatic output, and superior cross-file coherence. If you ship production code, Claude is the better model.<br><br>
    <strong>Gemini 2.5 Flash wins on speed and value.</strong> 4× faster generation (289 tok/s vs 70), 1M context (vs 200K), native multimodal, and completely free. If you prototype rapidly or work with visual data, Gemini is the pragmatic choice.<br><br>
    <strong>Use both: Claude for production code, Gemini for quick iterations and visual tasks.</strong>

## Core Scoring 📊

<div class="table-responsive">

| Dimension | Claude Opus 4 | Gemini 2.5 Flash |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Code Generation Quality (35%)** | 9.2 — idiomatic, well-typed, production-ready | 7.8 — correct, functional, less refined |
| **Context Understanding (35%)** | 9.5 — 200K, superior multi-file coherence | 8.0 — 1M window, less coherent at range |
| **Debug & Error Fixing (30%)** | 9.0 — surgical fixes, root cause analysis | 7.5 — finds common bugs, less precise |
| **Weighted Total** | **9.2 / 10** | **7.8 / 10** |

## Three Scenario Tests 🔬

### Scenario 1: Production Code Quality

**Test method:** Build a production microservice in TypeScript — auth middleware, database, rate limiting, error handling.

Claude Opus 4 delivered production-ready code with discriminated union error types, composable middleware, input validation beyond spec, and inline documentation. Gemini produced correct, working code but skipped edge-case handling, used simpler error patterns, and required more manual polishing. Both work; Claude's is merge-ready.

<div class="verdict-box"><div class="verdict-label">📝 Verdict</div><p class="verdict-text"><strong>Winner: Claude (9.2 vs 7.8).</strong> The gap is the last 15% — patterns, validation, documentation — that determines whether code survives its first refactor.</p></div>

### Scenario 2: Speed & Iteration

**Test method:** Generate 5 Python utility functions and measure total time.

Gemini generated all 5 functions in under 20 seconds — 4× faster than Claude. For rapid prototyping loops where you generate, test, iterate, and repeat, Gemini's speed advantage saves real minutes per session. The code was correct and functional — lacking Claude's polish, but good enough for prototyping.

<div class="verdict-box"><div class="verdict-label">📝 Verdict</div><p class="verdict-text"><strong>Winner: Gemini.</strong> 289 tok/s vs 70 tok/s. For speed-critical workflows, Gemini's velocity wins.</p></div>

### Scenario 3: Debugging

**Test method:** Distributed race condition across three microservices.

Claude traced the race through all services, identified the missing lock, and proposed a 20-line surgical fix. Gemini found the race but proposed a broader refactor. Both correct; Claude's fix was minimal and safer.

<div class="verdict-box"><div class="verdict-label">📝 Verdict</div><p class="verdict-text"><strong>Winner: Claude (9.0 vs 7.5).</strong> Surgical precision vs comprehensive-but-overengineered.</p></div>
