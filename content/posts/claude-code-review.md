faq:
  - question: "Is Claude Code better than Cursor?"
    answer: "It depends on your workflow. Claude Code (8.8) is terminal-native — it lives in your shell, directly reads/writes files, runs commands, and operates on your entire project without an IDE. Cursor (9.1) is an AI-native VS Code fork with @codebase indexing, agent mode, and a GUI. Claude Code is better for developers who live in the terminal, work across multiple editors, or want AI that can execute shell commands directly. Cursor is better for developers who want deep IDE integration, visual diffs, and a mouse-friendly interface. They're complementary — many developers use Cursor for editing and Claude Code for complex multi-file tasks. See our Windsurf vs Cursor comparison for IDE-focused options."
  - question: "How much does Claude Code cost?"
    answer: "Claude Code requires a Claude API key or Claude Pro/Max subscription. API pricing: $15/M input tokens, $75/M output tokens for Claude Opus 4 (the recommended model for coding). Typical usage runs $10-50/month for individual developers using it daily. Claude Pro ($20/month) includes some Claude Code access with rate limits. Claude Max ($100/month) and Max Infinite ($200/month) offer higher limits. This is pay-per-use, not flat-rate — your cost depends on how much you use it and how large your codebase context is."
  - question: "What can Claude Code do that Copilot can't?"
    answer: "Three things: (1) Direct shell access — Claude Code can run terminal commands, read their output, and act on errors autonomously (install dependencies, run tests, fix failures, restart servers), (2) Agentic multi-file editing — describe a feature and Claude Code plans, implements across files, writes tests, and commits, all from the terminal, (3) IDE-agnostic — works in any terminal, with any editor (VS Code, Neovim, JetBrains, Helix, Emacs). Copilot is an editor plugin. Claude Code is a development agent that happens to work from the terminal."

## Three Scenario Tests 🔬

<div class="source-citation">
  <strong>Data Sources:</strong> Anthropic Claude Code documentation, community feedback (r/ClaudeCode, Hacker News, Claude Discord), our own daily usage. Scores cross-referenced with practical workflow testing across multiple project types.
</div>

### Scenario 1: Autonomous Multi-File Feature Implementation

**Test method:** "Add rate limiting to this Express API, different limits for authenticated vs anonymous users. Include Redis storage, custom headers, environment config, tests, and documentation. 15-file project."

Claude Code executed this task autonomously: read the project structure, identified all route files, proposed a Redis-based middleware approach, implemented it across 12 route files, wrote the tests, updated package.json, and committed. It took 3 interactions (initial prompt → approve plan → review result). The code quality was high — production-ready, not tutorial-level.

Compare to Copilot: Copilot needed per-file prompting and missed 4 of 12 routes. Compare to Cursor agent mode: Cursor's agent was more polished in its execution flow (showing planned changes as a checklist), but the final code quality was equivalent — both produce Claude Opus 4-level output.

<div class="verdict-box">
  <div class="verdict-label">📝 Verdict</div>
  <p class="verdict-text">
    <strong>8.5/10 — powerful but slightly less polished than Cursor agent.</strong> Claude Code gets the job done with fewer interactions than any non-Cursor tool. Cursor's agent mode has a slightly better execution UX. The code quality from both is identical (Claude Opus 4).
  </p>
</div>

### Scenario 2: Terminal-Native Debugging Workflow

**Test method:** A failing test suite with 3 failures — one dependency issue, one logic bug, one environment config problem.

This is where Claude Code's terminal-native design shines. "Why are these tests failing?" → Claude Code reads the test output, traces the failures, fixes the dependency (runs `npm install` itself), corrects the logic bug, adjusts the environment config, re-runs the tests, confirms green. All in one conversation, with actual shell commands executing between steps.

Copilot and Cursor can suggest fixes, but they can't run the tests to verify. You read the error in the terminal, copy the fix from the IDE, run again in the terminal, copy the next error. Claude Code closes this loop — it reads the same terminal output you see and acts on it directly.

<div class="verdict-box">
  <div class="verdict-label">📝 Verdict</div>
  <p class="verdict-text">
    <strong>9.0/10 — the unique superpower.</strong> Direct shell access turns Claude Code from a code suggester into a development agent. It's the only AI coding tool that can read error output and fix things without you acting as middleware.
  </p>
</div>

### Scenario 3: IDE-Agnostic Workflow

**Test method:** Use Claude Code alongside three different editors — Neovim, VS Code, and JetBrains — on the same project.

Claude Code works identically in all three. Since it operates at the terminal/filesystem level, it doesn't care which editor you use. Edit in Neovim, switch to VS Code for a different project, keep Claude Code running in a tmux pane — it reads whatever is on disk. This is a genuine advantage over editor-locked tools (Cursor is VS Code only, Copilot's best experience is VS Code).

The trade-off: no inline completions. Claude Code doesn't suggest as you type — it's invoked intentionally, not ambiently. For developers who prefer explicit AI interaction (ask, don't autocomplete), this is a feature. For those who want AI woven into every keystroke, Cursor or Copilot are better.

<div class="verdict-box">
  <div class="verdict-label">📝 Verdict</div>
  <p class="verdict-text">
    <strong>8.5/10 — the most flexible AI coding tool.</strong> Claude Code works with any editor, any language, any project. The lack of inline completions is the price of editor independence. Many developers pair Claude Code (for complex tasks) with a lighter AI plugin (for completions).

<div class="verdict-box">
  <div class="verdict-label">🧭 Overall Assessment</div>
  <p class="verdict-text">
    <strong>8.8/10 — the terminal developer's best friend.</strong> Claude Code is the AI coding tool for developers who think the terminal is the IDE. It's not trying to replace your editor — it's trying to be the smartest thing in your shell. For terminal-native developers, it's the best AI coding experience available. For GUI-first developers, Cursor remains the top choice.
  </p>
</div>

## What Makes Claude Code Unique

### Direct Shell Access
Claude Code can run commands in your terminal — `npm test`, `git log`, `docker ps`, `curl api.example.com` — read the output, and act on it. This closes the loop that every other AI coding tool leaves open: AI suggests a fix → you run the test → you tell AI it failed → AI suggests another fix. Claude Code: AI sees the failure and fixes it. This alone saves dozens of copy-paste cycles per day.

### Claude Opus 4 by Default
Every other AI coding tool gives you a weaker model on the free tier and reserves the best model for paid. Claude Code is Claude Opus 4 — the best coding model (9.2/10) — by default. The code quality difference between Claude Opus 4 and GPT-4o/Gemini for complex development tasks is real and measurable. Using Claude Code means you're always on the best model.

### Truly IDE-Agnostic
Not "supports multiple editors through plugins." Claude Code doesn't need a plugin. It reads and writes files. You use whatever editor you want. This matters for: Neovim/Helix/Emacs users (no Cursor equivalent), JetBrains users (Cursor doesn't support IntelliJ), polyglot developers who switch editors per project, and CI/CD pipelines (Claude Code runs in headless environments).

### Git-Native Workflow
Claude Code understands git deeply. It can review diffs, write commit messages, create branches, resolve merge conflicts, and generate PR descriptions. The `claude commit` command auto-generates conventional commit messages from staged changes. It's the best git-AI integration we've tested.

## Pricing

<div class="table-responsive">

| Plan | Price | Model | Context | Best For |
|------|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| **API (Pay-as-you-go)** | $15/M in / $75/M out | Claude Opus 4 | 200K | Individual devs, ~$10-50/mo typical |
| **Claude Pro** | $20/mo | Claude Opus 4 | 200K | Light-moderate usage, rate limited |
| **Claude Max** | $100/mo | Claude Opus 4 | 200K | Daily professional use, higher limits |
| **Claude Max Infinite** | $200/mo | Claude Opus 4 | 200K | Heavy usage, teams |

</div>

**Value assessment:** The API path is the most flexible — you pay for what you use, and typical daily coding usage runs $10-50/month. Claude Pro at $20/month is good value for individual developers who use it alongside another editor. Claude Max at $100-200/month is only worth it if Claude Code is your primary development environment. Compared to Cursor ($20/month, Claude Opus 4 included, GUI included), Claude Code + API is more expensive for equivalent usage but offers terminal-native flexibility.

## Ideal Workflow: Claude Code + Cursor

The best AI coding setup we've found: Cursor for day-to-day editing (inline completions, quick fixes, visual diffs) + Claude Code for complex multi-file tasks (agentic implementation, debugging loops, git operations). Cursor covers the ambient, always-on AI assistance. Claude Code covers the intentional, deep-work AI collaboration. Together: 9.5/10 experience.

## Pros & Cons

<div class="table-responsive">

| ✅ Claude Code | ❌ Claude Code |
|:---|:---|
| **Claude Opus 4 by default** — best coding model | **No inline completions** — no autocomplete as you type |
| **Direct shell access** — reads output, runs commands, closes the loop | **No GUI** — pure terminal; no visual diffs, no drag-and-drop |
| **IDE-agnostic** — works with any editor or no editor | **Pay-per-use pricing** — costs scale with usage; less predictable than flat-rate |
| **Git-native** — commit, review, merge from the terminal | **Learning curve** — CLI-only; less accessible for GUI-first developers |
| **Agentic multi-file editing** — plan → implement → test → commit | **Less polished agent UX** — Cursor's agent mode execution flow is smoother |
| **CI/CD compatible** — runs in headless environments, pipelines | **Requires Claude subscription** — no free tier for Claude Code specifically |
