faq:
  - question: "Is Qwen free?"
    answer: "Yes — Qwen models are open weights (Apache 2.0 for most), free to use via Qwen Chat, and self-hostable on your own hardware. The API is among the cheapest of major models. Alibaba also offers free Qwen-powered apps: the Qwen assistant app and Tongyi. For developers who want an open model without paying OpenAI/Anthropic: Qwen is one of the strongest options."
  - question: "Is Qwen better than DeepSeek?"
    answer: "Close, with different strengths. DeepSeek (7.7) is a slightly stronger value for pure reasoning and math, and its R1 reasoning mode is excellent. Qwen (7.6) counters with better multimodal capabilities (vision, images), stronger tool use and agentic behavior, and a wider model family (Qwen Coder, Qwen VL). For coding and multimodal apps: Qwen. For pure reasoning on a budget: DeepSeek. Both are open-weight and cheap."

## TL;DR: Quick Verdict ⚡

<div class="verdict-box">
  <div class="verdict-label">⚡ Bottom Line</div>
  <p class="verdict-text">
    <strong>Qwen is the most versatile open-source AI family — and Qwen Coder is a genuine Copilot alternative.</strong> It scores 7.6/10.<br><br>
    Alibaba's Qwen 3 covers everything: a general chatbot, a strong coder model, vision models, and small models that run on phones. All open weights, all free to self-host, with one of the cheapest APIs among major models.<br><br>
    It doesn't beat ChatGPT or Claude on raw quality, but it's within striking distance — and it costs dramatically less, with no vendor lock-in.<br><br>
    <strong>For developers and budget-conscious builders who want open models: Qwen is a top-three choice worldwide.</strong>

## What Qwen Is

Qwen ("Tongyi Qianwen") is Alibaba Cloud's open-source model family, first released in 2023. By 2026 it has become one of the two most-used open model families on Earth (alongside Meta's Llama).

- **Qwen 3** — flagship general model, 0.6B to 235B parameters, reasoning modes
- **Qwen Coder** — code-specialized variant, strong in SWE-bench-style benchmarks
- **Qwen VL** — vision-language model for images and documents
- **Qwen Chat** — free hosted chat at chat.qwen.ai
- **Open weights** — Apache 2.0 license for most models
- **Cheap API** — via Alibaba Cloud Model Studio and third-party hosts

## Qwen Scorecard

<div class="table-responsive">

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Model Quality (40%)** | 7.5 | Near-frontier; strong coding and multilingual ability |
| **Open Source & Flexibility (30%)** | 9.0 | Apache 2.0, self-hostable, huge derivative ecosystem |
| **Ecosystem & Access (30%)** | 6.5 | Chat app is fine; tooling less polished than OpenAI's |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.6 / 10** | Best all-round open-source family for builders |

</div>

## 3 Key Tests

### Test 1: General Chat and Reasoning
**Task:** Mixed questions: analysis, writing, logic puzzles, multilingual queries. **Result:** Solid across the board — better than Meta AI, roughly on par with DeepSeek. Chinese and English both strong (unsurprisingly, given Alibaba's roots), and its 30+ language support is genuinely useful. Reasoning mode handles multi-step problems competently, a notch below Claude but above most open models.

<div class="verdict-box"><div class="verdict-label">📝 Verdict</div><p class="verdict-text"><strong>Near-frontier general quality — the best multilingual open model.</strong></p></div>

### Test 2: Coding with Qwen Coder
**Task:** Implement a rate limiter with tests, then a small React component with styling. **Result:** Qwen Coder produced correct, idiomatic code on the first attempt for the rate limiter and after one fix cycle for the React component. In agentic coding workflows (via Cline or other harnesses), Qwen Coder at ~1/20th of Claude's API price delivered maybe 85% of the capability — an extraordinary cost-to-capability ratio for budget projects.

<div class="verdict-box"><div class="verdict-label">📝 Verdict</div><p class="verdict-text"><strong>Qwen Coder is the value king of AI coding — 85% of Claude for 5% of the price.</strong></p></div>

### Test 3: Self-Hosting
**Task:** Run a 14B-parameter Qwen model locally via Ollama on a mid-range GPU. **Result:** Works well — useful quality for private, offline, and cost-sensitive workloads. No data leaves your machine, no API bills. The 14B model is no frontier model, but for privacy-sensitive or high-volume use cases, self-hosted Qwen beats any hosted model on cost and control.

<div class="verdict-box"><div class="verdict-label">📝 Verdict</div><p class="verdict-text"><strong>Self-hosting works — privacy and zero marginal cost are real advantages.</strong></p></div>

## Pricing

<div class="table-responsive">

| Option | Cost |
|--------|------|
| **Qwen Chat (hosted)** | Free |
| **API (Model Studio)** | ~$0.10-0.70 per million tokens — among the cheapest major APIs |
| **Self-hosted** | $0 + your hardware (14B runs on mid-range GPU) |

</div>

## Pros & Cons

<div class="table-responsive">

| ✅ Qwen | ❌ Qwen |
|:---|:---|
| **Open weights** — Apache 2.0, self-host freely | **Below frontier quality** — trails Claude/ChatGPT |
| **Qwen Coder** — elite cost-to-capability ratio | **Less polished tools** — chat app is basic |
| **Multilingual** — 30+ languages, excellent Chinese | **Western ecosystem weaker** — fewer integrations |
| **Cheapest API** among major models | **Marketing/mindshare** below OpenAI/Anthropic |
| **Model variety** — from phone-size to flagship | **Fewer safety guarantees** than hosted leaders |
