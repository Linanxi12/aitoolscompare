faq:
  - question: "Is Cline free?"
    answer: "The extension is free and open source — you pay only for the AI model's API usage (Claude via Anthropic, or any other provider). Typical usage costs $5-30/month of API credits depending on workload, often cheaper than subscription tools, with no monthly minimum. You can also connect local models via Ollama or LM Studio to run it completely free."
  - question: "Is Cline better than Claude Code?"
    answer: "No. Claude Code (8.8) is Anthropic's own agent and remains the most capable and reliable coding agent — better at long autonomous tasks and edge cases. Cline (8.2) is the best open-source alternative: it's also powered by Claude models, works in VS Code with a GUI, and lets you swap models or self-host. For maximum capability: Claude Code. For open-source flexibility, visual UI, and no vendor lock-in: Cline."

## TL;DR: Quick Verdict ⚡

<div class="verdict-box">
  <div class="verdict-label">⚡ Bottom Line</div>
  <p class="verdict-text">
    <strong>Cline is the best open-source AI coding agent — Claude-powered autonomy without subscription lock-in.</strong> It scores 8.2/10.<br><br>
    Install the VS Code extension, add an API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or a local model), and Cline reads your files, plans changes, edits across the codebase, runs commands, and fixes its own errors — with every action visible and approvable in the UI.<br><br>
    Pay-per-use pricing means light users pay a few dollars a month; there's no $20 subscription to justify. And unlike Claude Code's terminal, Cline gives you a visual Plan/Act interface and full MCP tool support.<br><br>
    <strong>For autonomy on your own terms — open source, pay-per-use, any model: Cline is the best choice after Claude Code itself.</strong>

## What Cline Does

Cline (formerly Claude Dev) is an open-source autonomous coding agent that lives inside VS Code (and JetBrains via a fork). It started in 2024 and became the most-starred coding agent on GitHub within months.

- **Plan/Act mode** — presents a plan, waits for approval, then executes
- **Reads and edits files** across your entire project
- **Runs terminal commands** — installs dependencies, runs tests, git operations
- **Self-healing loops** — runs your tests, reads failures, fixes, retries
- **MCP support** — connects to external tools (browsers, databases, docs)
- **Any model** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, or local via Ollama
- **Browser use** (optional) — click through web apps to verify UI work

## Cline Scorecard

<div class="table-responsive">

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Capability (40%)** | 8.5 | Claude-powered; near Claude Code level on most tasks |
| **Autonomy & Reliability (30%)** | 8.0 | Strong loops; occasional drift on very long tasks |
| **Cost & Transparency (20%)** | 8.0 | Pay-per-use, open source, no lock-in |
| **Polish & UX (10%)** | 7.5 | Good GUI; setup requires an API key |
| **Weighted Total** | **8.2 / 10** | Best open-source coding agent |

## 3 Key Tests

### Test 1: Feature Implementation
**Task:** "Add CSV export to this reporting module, with a download button and tests." **Result:** Cline planned the change (new helper, button in UI, test file), executed across four files, ran the test suite, and fixed one failing test on its own. Output quality matched Claude Code on this task — same underlying model, similar results. The visual diff review in VS Code makes approving changes feel safer than terminal agents.

<div class="verdict-box"><div class="verdict-label">📝 Verdict</div><p class="verdict-text"><strong>Near Claude Code capability with a visual review UI.</strong></p></div>

### Test 2: Long Autonomous Task
**Task:** "Migrate this project from JavaScript to TypeScript." (~30 files) **Result:** Strong start — converted 24 files correctly. Then drift: it began making style changes nobody asked for, and one edge-case type error took three fix cycles. Claude Code handles these long tasks with tighter discipline; Cline needed two intervention prompts. For tasks under ~30 minutes of agent time: excellent. For day-long autonomous runs: supervise.

<div class="verdict-box"><div class="verdict-label">📝 Verdict</div><p class="verdict-text"><strong>Excellent on medium tasks; supervise long migrations.</strong></p></div>

### Test 3: Cost Reality Check
**Task:** Track API spend over two weeks of daily use (mix of features, bug fixes, refactors). **Result:** $14.30 total with Claude Sonnet — under a Copilot/Windsurf subscription, and with zero monthly commitment. Heavy autonomy days cost more ($3-4/day), light days cost cents. The transparency is the point: you see every token. For teams, an API budget of $25/person/month typically exceeds what a subscription tool would give.

## Pricing

<div class="table-responsive">

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| **Cline extension** | Free, open source (Apache 2.0) |
| **Claude API** | ~$3/million input tokens, ~$15/million output (Sonnet) |
| **Alternative models** | OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek (much cheaper) |
| **Local models** | $0 — Ollama/LM Studio on your GPU |

</div>

*Typical user spend: $5-30/month depending on workload. No subscription required.*

## Pros & Cons

<div class="table-responsive">

| ✅ Cline | ❌ Cline |
|:---|:---|
| **Open source** — no vendor lock-in | **API key setup** — less beginner-friendly |
| **Pay-per-use** — cheaper than subscriptions for light use | **Drift on long tasks** — needs supervision |
| **Any model** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, local | **VS Code-centric** — JetBrains via fork |
| **Plan/Act UI** — review before it executes | **No first-party team features** |
| **MCP support** — connect external tools | **Cost spikes** possible on heavy autonomy days |

</div>
